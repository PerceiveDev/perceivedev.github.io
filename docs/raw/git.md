# Git Guidelines
These are the guidelines that members of Perceive **must** follow when using *git*.

- Team repositories must have a README and description
- Always use the [team's .gitignore](https://github.com/PerceiveDev/PerceiveResources/blob/master/templates/gitignore)
- Keep commit messages short and meaningful
- Describe all changes to the code in a commit's description
- Commit often to avoid git conflicts with other people, and to allow easy viewing of the history of a project. This also makes it easier to go back to an earlier version of the code if somethings gets messed up.
