# Requests
There isn't much that you need to do to request a plugin from us, but before you do you need to know the following three things:

- We build our plugins with Java 8
- We do not support Minecraft versions earlier than 1.8
- A lot of our plugins rely on our library, [PerceiveCore](https://www.github.com/PerceiveDev/PerceiveCore/tree/dev). Downloads can be found [on our Jenkins server](https://ci-perceive.rhcloud.com).

As for the requests themselves, please fill out all the information in the [premade form](https://www.github.com/PerceiveDev/PerceiveRequests/issues/new), and be civil. We don't tend to want to help people that are rude.
